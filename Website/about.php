          <td align="left" valign="top"> <p>100% of proceeds will benefit Mimi's Magic Fund at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The funds will be directed to do research and find cures for rare cancers and to provide art therapy for cancer patients. Rare cancers do not get the headlines of some of the other well-known strains of this disease. &nbsp;Most rare cancers are deadly. Mimi lost her battle to one of these rare cancers. &nbsp;In fact over a 100,000 people a year also succumb to rare cancers. &nbsp;We believe it is important that we do not loose sight of this deadly disease and we support research to find cures.</p>
<p>Mimi was a talented artist in her own right, she clearly understood the therapeutic comfort that art provides. &nbsp;We believe it is very important to support the hospitals program to provide this kind of meaningful art therapy.</p>
<p>Mimi's Magic Fund has encouraged family and friends to engage in fund raising cycling marathons, bar events, and personal giving.Â  In 5 months of our first year the fund has raised over $25,000 and is planning events for next fall in New York and then onward to Washington DC and Miami.</p>
